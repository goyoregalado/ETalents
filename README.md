A project started while attending the [amazing course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-python-by-building-a-blockchain-cryptocurrency/) by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

At this moment this is, basically the code developed during the course,
but under the hood there's an little idea.

What about building a educational cryptocurrency which can be used
in students assesment as a measure of their educational commitment.

Ahí lo dejo ... ;)
